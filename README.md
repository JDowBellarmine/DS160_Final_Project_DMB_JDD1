Can one predict whether someone is occupying a room or not using only scientific measurements? We can. Given a data set that measures multiple environmental variables of a room and if it is occupied or empty, we are able to predict the occupancy of the room to extreme precision given only the measurements. Through the entire data analysis process of cleaning and manipulating our data to a useful form, we use machine learning to generate our predictions. Creating and running different machine learning models, we are able to build a model the predicts to a 99% accuracy. Given certain measurements we can tell if anyone is there.
